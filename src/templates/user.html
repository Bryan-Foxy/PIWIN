        <p>
        This Dashboard is designed to help network administrators monitor and optimize the performance of the operator's IP central network. It is divided into several tabs, each offering a unique view of network performance data.
        The "Network Interface" tab allows you to view network data such as traffic and bandwidth to monitor network performance and take measures to optimize it.</p>
        
        <p>You can also view trend charts to track network performance over a given period of time.
        The "Physical Interface" tab allows you to view data on physical equipment such as routers and switches to monitor their status and detect potential problems. You can also view charts to track the performance of physical equipment and identify potential bottlenecks.
        The "Virtual Interface" tab allows you to analyze virtual network data to optimize virtual services based on NFV. You can view charts to track the performance of virtual services and detect potential problems.
        The "Alert Management" tab allows you to manage alerts generated by the system. When the bar is red, a fault alert is triggered. When the bar is orange, a danger alert is triggered. And when the bar is green, no alert is triggered. You can also configure custom alert thresholds based on your specific needs.</p>
